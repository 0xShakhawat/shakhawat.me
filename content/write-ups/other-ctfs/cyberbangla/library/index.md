## CTF NAME: Library  
**Point:** 50  
**Category:** Web  
**Description:**  
Welcome to the virtual library, a treasure trove of knowledge where every search brings you closer to uncovering hidden gems. But not everything is as it seems. The search function is your key — type in the right words, and it might just lead you to something unexpected.

**Hint:** where you can read your books?

**Flag:** CBCTF{you_d1d_grea8_j0b}

**Solve:**  
This one was hard to think. And It’s completely out of the box and it’s beyond my imagination. I have struggled a lot with this one.

The webpage with just an input field.

I tried almost everything I knew about the input field like this. I even can’t solve it after the hint. I gave up and moved to another problem called forbidden, suddenly I remembered the word “**table**” because of the hint. Then I input the word and booooom I got the flag.
