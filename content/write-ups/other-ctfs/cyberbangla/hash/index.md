Flag Format: CBCTF{**}

**Flag:** CBCTF{cyb3rbangla}

**Solve:**  
At first, It’s a hash, not a cipher text. So, there is limited option. Because, In ctf they will not give you a random hash.

At the start, I Identified the hash with my favorite hash analyzer TunnelsUp.

It’s Sha256 hash.

Then, I thought about making a wordlist about Cyber Bangla Academy. At that time, I remembered an online hash decrypter with a large database called md5hashing.net. So, I used that first.
