## Generating Code Snippets in Postman

Postman's code generation feature simplifies integrating API calls into applications by generating code snippets in various programming languages.

### Generating Code

For any request, click the "Code" link (</> icon) on the right side of the Postman window.

In the code snippet generator pane, select the desired programming language from the dropdown menu (e.g., Python, JavaScript, C, NodeJS).

### Example: cURL Snippet for GET /books

Generating a cURL snippet for the `GET /books` request produces a command-line command that can be executed in a terminal:

   ![cURL Snippet](https://everpath-course-content.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/instructor%2F26fp2261340y1ukokimvca8su%2Fpublic%2F1649891410%2Frecap+3.1649891410496.png)

Pasting this snippet into a terminal and pressing Enter executes the API call and prints the response body.

While functional, viewing and interpreting API responses within Postman offers a more user-friendly experience.  This feature allows easy integration of API calls into various applications.
