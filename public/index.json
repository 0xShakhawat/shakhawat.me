Today, I\u0026rsquo;m excited to share that feeling with you as I announce the completion of SubNetter – my very own subnet and VLSM calculator!\nThe Spark of an Idea: #\rIt all started with frustration. As I delved deeper into the world of networking and cybersecurity, I kept encountering clunky and unintuitive subnet calculators. I thought, \u0026ldquo;There has to be a better way!\u0026rdquo; That\u0026rsquo;s when the seed for SubNetter was planted.\nDual-Wielding Code: #\rSubnetter wasn\u0026rsquo;t just one project; it became two interwoven journeys. I decided to build both a command-line interface (CLI) using Python and a full-fledged Android app with Flutter. I wanted to challenge myself and learn new skills along the way.\nPython Power-Up: #\rBuilding the CLI version of SubNetter forced me to level up my Python skills. I learned about the ipaddress library, parsing arguments with argparse, and even how to create beautifully formatted table output with tabulate. It was satisfying to see the logic come together, taking user input and spitting out accurate subnet calculations.\nFlutter Frenzy (and Fun!): #\rOn the app side, Flutter was a whole new world. I had to wrap my head around widgets, state management, layouts, and navigation. It was a steep learning curve, but also immensely rewarding. Building a functional app with a user-friendly UI/UX felt like magic.\nThe Lessons Learned: #\rBeyond the technical skills, this project taught me valuable lessons:\nPersistence: There were moments of doubt and frustration, but I pushed through and learned how to debug and solve problems. Planning: I realized the importance of planning before diving into code. Sketching out UI designs and thinking through the CLI\u0026rsquo;s flow saved me time in the long run. Iteration: I learned to embrace the process of making incremental improvements. SubNetter didn\u0026rsquo;t start perfect, but it got better with each iteration. The Project Lives On: #\rSubnetter is now available as both a Python CLI https://github.com/0xShakhawat/subnetter and an Android app on the Play Store https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.shakhawat.subnetter. I\u0026rsquo;m incredibly proud of what I\u0026rsquo;ve built, and I can\u0026rsquo;t wait to see how people use it.\nView Project #\rSubNetter - IP Subnet and VLSM Calculator (CLI \u0026 Android App)\r#\rThis is just the beginning! I\u0026rsquo;m already brainstorming new features and updates for SubNetter, and I\u0026rsquo;m excited to continue exploring the world of software development.\n#SubnetCalculator #Python #Flutter #AndroidDev #Cybersecurity #FirstProject #LearningToCode\n","date":"7 September 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blogs/my-first-project-journey-subnetter/","section":"Blogs","summary":"","title":"Level Up: My First Project Journey - SubNetter, A Subnet Calculator","type":"blogs"},{"content":"","date":"7 September 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/networking/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Networking","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"7 September 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/projects/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Projects","type":"categories"},{"content":"","date":"7 September 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/python/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Python","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"7 September 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/subnetcalculator/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"SubnetCalculator","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"7 September 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":"In this writeup, we will walk through the exploitation of the \u0026ldquo;Academy\u0026rdquo; machine from TCM-SEC Academy.

This blog post aims to demystify the intricacies of RSA encryption and decryption, using the versatile OpenSSL tool.\nOverview of RSA #\rRSA, named after its inventors Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman, relies on the mathematical properties of large prime numbers. It involves the generation of a public key for encryption and a corresponding private key for decryption. This asymmetry forms the basis for secure data transmission and digital signatures.\nSetting Up OpenSSL #\rBefore delving into RSA operations, ensure you have OpenSSL installed. The installation process varies across operating systems, but OpenSSL’s command-line interface remains consistent.\n# Install OpenSSL on Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)\rsudo apt-get install openssl\r# Install OpenSSL on macOS (using Homebrew)\rbrew install openssl\r# Install OpenSSL on Windows\rDownload and install the binaries from https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html Generating RSA Key Pair #\rLet’s kick things off by generating an RSA key pair. The following commands create a private key (private.pem)\nopenssl genrsa --out private.pem 1024\nI used 1048bit, you can use 2048bit or 3072bit for larger message encryption. I used (.pem) as an extension but you can use anything like (.txt), Etc. But (.pem) is better. PEM stands for Privacy Enhanced Mail.\nHere is our private key:\nLet’s create a public key from this private key.\nopenssl rsa --in private.pem --out public.pem --outform PEM --pubout\nI am using this command. Here is the result.\nCreating a Message file I used echo to create a txt file message. The file name is “msg.txt”\necho \u0026quot;Hi friend. How are you?\u0026quot; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; msg.txt\nThe message is: “Hi friend. How are you?”\nEncrypting Data with RSA #\rNow that we have our keys, let’s encrypt some data using the public key. This ensures that only the possessor of the private key can decrypt and access the original information.\nopenssl pkeyutl --encrypt --inkey public.pem --pubin --in msg.txt --out enmsg.enc\nnow I have an encrypted data file named enmsg.enc\nAnd I can safely delete my unencrypted message.\nI use the rm command to remove the unencrypted message file.\nnow I have only an encrypted message file.\nDecrypting Data with RSA #\rTo decrypt the data, we utilize the private key. This step ensures that only the rightful owner of the private key can reveal the original content.\nopenssl pkeyutl --decrypt --inkey private.pem --in enmsg.enc --out message.txt\nI used this command to decrypt the message. Now, I can view the message in plaintext.\nBest Practices and Security Considerations #\rAs we venture into the cryptographic landscape, it’s essential to adopt best practices. Securely storing private keys and considering key length are crucial aspects. Regularly check for updates and be mindful of potential vulnerabilities associated with OpenSSL.\nConclusion #\rIn conclusion, RSA encryption and decryption, coupled with OpenSSL, provide a robust foundation for securing digital communication. By understanding the principles and practices outlined in this post, you’re equipped to navigate the intricacies of RSA cryptography.\nAdditional Resources #\rFor further exploration, refer to the official OpenSSL documentation, and consider practical exercises to deepen your understanding.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s it.\nI also published blog this on my Medium Blog\nYou guys can subscribe to my YouTube channel 0xShakhawat My portfolio site: https://shakhawat.me\n","date":"6 December 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blogs/rsa-encryption-and-decryption-with-openssl/","section":"Blogs","summary":"","title":"Demystifying RSA Encryption and Decryption with OpenSSL","type":"blogs"},{"content":"","date":"6 December 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/infosec/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Infosec","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"6 December 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/rsa-algorithm/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Rsa-Algorithm","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"29 July 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/cybersecurity/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Cybersecurity","type":"categories"},{"content":"One year ago, I embarked on my ethical hacking journey by exploring a vulnerable machine in a controlled environment (like VulnHub).

Today, I\u0026rsquo;m revisiting that experience to share the steps involved in a safe and ethical exploration of a vulnerable machine.\nEthical Considerations #\rBefore we dive in, it\u0026rsquo;s crucial to understand that ethical hacking is all about permission.

Vulnerability assessment (VA) is a critical component of any effective cybersecurity strategy, enabling organizations to identify, prioritize, and remediate security weaknesses before they can be exploited by malicious actors.\nIn this guide, we\u0026rsquo;ll provide a comprehensive overview of vulnerability assessment, including what it is, why it matters, and how to conduct a successful assessment.\nWhat is vulnerability assessment? #\rVulnerability assessment is the process of identifying and quantifying security weaknesses in an organization\u0026rsquo;s IT systems, applications, and networks. These weaknesses, or vulnerabilities, can range from software flaws and misconfigurations to known exploits and insider threats.\nWhy is vulnerability assessment important? #\rVulnerability assessment is important for several reasons:\nReduce the risk of cyberattacks: By identifying and addressing security weaknesses, organizations can reduce the likelihood of successful cyberattacks.\nComply with regulations: Many industries are subject to regulatory requirements for cybersecurity, and vulnerability assessment is often a key component of compliance.\nProtect sensitive data: Vulnerability assessment can help identify weaknesses in systems that house sensitive data, such as customer information or intellectual property.\nImprove overall security posture: Vulnerability assessment can help organizations identify areas where their security posture can be strengthened, leading to better protection against all types of cyber threats.\nTypes of vulnerability assessments #\rThere are several types of vulnerability assessments, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Here are the most common types:\nNetwork-based vulnerability assessment: #\rThis type of assessment involves scanning a network for vulnerabilities, typically using automated tools. Network-based assessments can be useful for identifying vulnerabilities in large, complex networks.\nHost-based vulnerability assessment: #\rThis type of assessment involves scanning individual hosts, such as servers or workstations, for vulnerabilities. Host-based assessments can be useful for identifying vulnerabilities that may not be detectable through network-based assessments.\nApplication-based vulnerability assessment: #\rThis type of assessment involves testing applications for vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS). Application-based assessments can be useful for identifying vulnerabilities that are specific to a particular application.\nCloud-based vulnerability assessment: #\rThis type of assessment involves assessing vulnerabilities in cloud-based environments, such as those hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Microsoft Azure. Cloud-based assessments can be useful for identifying vulnerabilities that are unique to cloud environments.\nHow to conduct a vulnerability assessment? #\rA successful vulnerability assessment involves several key steps:\nDefine the scope: #\rDetermine which systems, applications, and networks will be included in the assessment.\nIdentify assets: #\rCreate an inventory of all assets within the scope of the assessment, including hardware, software, and data.\nIdentify vulnerabilities: #\rUse a combination of automated tools and manual techniques to identify security weaknesses in the identified assets.\nPrioritize vulnerabilities: #\rAssign a risk level to each identified vulnerability based on its potential impact on the organization.\nRemediate vulnerabilities: #\rDevelop a plan to address and remediate identified vulnerabilities, prioritizing those with the highest risk level.\nMonitor and re-assess: #\rRegularly monitor and re-assess systems to identify new vulnerabilities and ensure that remediation efforts are effective.\nVulnerability Assessment Tools #\rThere are many tools available to help organizations conduct vulnerability assessments, including both open source and commercial tools. Some of the most popular vulnerability assessment tools include:\nNessus #\rA widely-used commercial tool for network-based vulnerability assessment.\nOpenVAS #\rAn open source network vulnerability scanner.\nBurp Suite #\rA popular commercial tool for application-based vulnerability assessment.\nQualys #\rA cloud-based vulnerability assessment platform that can be used for network, web application, and cloud-based assessments.\nNmap #\rA popular open source tool for network exploration and security auditing.\nVulnerability Assessment vs. Penetration Testing #\rWhile vulnerability assessment and penetration testing (pen testing) are often used interchangeably, they are actually two distinct processes. Vulnerability assessment is the process of identifying and quantifying security weaknesses in an organization\u0026rsquo;s IT systems, applications, and networks, while pen testing involves simulating a real-world attack to test an organization\u0026rsquo;s security defenses.\nThe main difference between vulnerability assessment and pen testing is that vulnerability assessment is a passive process, while pen testing is an active process. In other words, vulnerability assessment is focused on identifying security\nConclusion #\rVulnerability assessment is a critical component of any effective cybersecurity strategy, enabling organizations to identify and address security weaknesses before they can be exploited by malicious actors. By following the steps outlined in this guide, organizations can conduct successful vulnerability assessments and strengthen their overall security posture. Remember, cybersecurity is an ongoing process, and regular vulnerability assessments are essential to ensuring that systems remain secure and resilient against evolving cyber threats.\n#Vulnerability Assessment #0xShakhawat\nwanna support my work! well just buy me a coffee\nFollow Shakhawat Hossain for more cybersecurity posts \u0026amp; subscribe my YouTube channel 0xShakhawat.\n","date":"5 May 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blogs/vulnerability-assessment-a-complete-guide/","section":"Blogs","summary":"","title":"Vulnerability Assessment: A Complete Guide","type":"blogs"},{"content":"When users have stated their identity, it is necessary to validate that they are the rightful owners of that identity. This process of verifying or proving the user’s identification is known as authentication.\n“Access control process validating that the identity being claimed by a user or entity is known to the system, by comparing one (single-factor or SFA) or more (multi-factor authentication or MFA) factors of identification”\nSimply put, authentication is a process to prove the identity of the requestor.\nThere are three common methods of authentication:\nSomething you know: Passwords or paraphrases Something you have: Tokens, memory cards, smart cards Something you are: Biometrics, measurable characteristics Methods of Authentication #\rThere are two types of authentication. Using only one of the methods of authentication stated previously is known as single-factor authentication (SFA). Granting users access only after successfully demonstrating or displaying two or more of these methods is known as multi-factor authentication (MFA).\nCommon best practice is to implement at least two of the three common techniques for authentication:\nKnowledge-based Token-based Characteristic-based Knowledge-based authentication uses a passphrase or secret code to differentiate between an authorized and unauthorized user. If you have selected a personal identification number (PIN), created a password or some other secret value that only you know, then you have experienced knowledge-based authentication. The problem with using this type of authentication alone is that it is often vulnerable to a variety of attacks. For example, the help desk might receive a call to reset a user’s password. The challenge is ensuring that the password is reset only for the correct user and not someone else pretending to be that user. For better security, a second or third form of authentication that is based on a token or characteristic would be required prior to resetting the password. The combined use of a user ID and a password consists of two things that are known, and because it does not meet the requirement of using two or more of the authentication methods stated, it is not considered MFA.\n#CyberSec #0xShakhawat\nFollow Shakhawat Hossain for more cybersecurity posts \u0026amp; subscribe my YouTube channel 0xShakhawat.\n","date":"26 December 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blogs/authentication-cybersecurity/","section":"Blogs","summary":"","title":"Authentication :: Cybersecurity","type":"blogs"},{"content":"","date":"26 December 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/basics/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Basics","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"26 December 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/cybersecurity/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Cybersecurity","type":"tags"},{"content":"MAC address is stands Media Access Control Address It ensures that the physical address of the Computer is unique.\nMAC spoofing is a technique for changing a factory-assigned Media Access Control (​MAC) address of a network interface on a networked device.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s just like taking over someone else\u0026rsquo;s identity and performing action by impersonating them.\nMAC Spoofing plays a major role when it comes to network hacking. MAC spoofing helps you overtake the identity of some other device in the network and plays a major role in one of the most dangerous attacks called Man-in-the Middle.\n​Example of a MAC Address - 07-1B-63-4e-45-E6\nIt is a permanent, physical, and unique address assigned to network interfaces by the manufacturer.\nSo, whether it is a wireless card or a wired ethernet card, each of these cards comes up with addresses that are unique to themselves.\nAs we know, an IP address is used on the internet to identify computers and communicate between the devices.\nSimilarly, the MAC address is used within the network to identify devices and transfer data between devices.\nThus, each piece of data or a packet that is sent within the network contains a source MAC and a destination MAC.\nTherefore, this packet would flow from the source MAC to the destination MAC.\nHow To Check MAC Address #\rWindows System #\r​Run the command ipconfig /all\nto check the MAC address of various network cards on your Windows system.\nLinux System #\r​Run the command ifconfig\nto check the MAC address of various network cards on your Kali Linux system.\nWhy changing the MAC Address? #\rSince this is a physical unique address to each interface, to each network device, and because it is used to identify devices, then changing it will make you anonymous on the network.\nNot only that, but the MAC address is often used by filters to prevent or allow devices to connect to networks, and do specific tasks on the network.\nSo, being able to change your MAC address to another device\u0026rsquo;s MAC address will allow you to impersonate this device and allow you to do things that you might not be able to do.\nSo, you\u0026rsquo;d be able to bypass filters or connect to networks that only specific device with specific MAC addresses can connect to, and you will also be able to hide your identity. Interesting, riright\nTime For Practical #\rYou now know what a MAC address is and its related concepts.\nIt is time for some practical implementation and actually performing MAC spoofing.\nOn Kali/Linux #\r​Get your ​Kali​ ready, open up the terminal, and let\u0026rsquo;s start\u0026hellip;\nSteps\nBelow are the steps that will help us change the MAC address,\nDisable the interface you want to change the MAC address for Change the MAC address Change the MAC address Enable the interface Simple right? Now let\u0026rsquo;s see how it\u0026rsquo;s done.\nRun the command ifconfig\nCheck the interface you want to change the MAC for, let\u0026rsquo;s say it is the interface eth0.\nIn the response returned by the ifconfig command look for the entry \u0026ldquo;ether\u0026rdquo;. This will contain the corresponding MAC address.\nRemember: Once we change the MAC address, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t stay forever, once you restart the system, the original MAC automatically replaces the spoofed one.\nFollow the steps and run the given commands,\nDisable the interface: ifconfig eth0 down Here eth0 is the name of the interface we want to change the MAC for. Change the MAC: ifconfig eth0 hw ether 00:11:22:33:44:55 Here \u0026lsquo;hw\u0026rsquo; stands for hardware interface and \u0026lsquo;00:11:22:33:44:55\u0026rsquo; is the fake MAC that we have given to change the MAC. The Mac address will be changed to this given random address. Enable the interface: ifconfig eth0 up Now simply run the command ifconfig and check! The MAC address will be changed\u0026hellip;\nLet\u0026rsquo;s do it on Windows now #\rChanging MAC on Kali was really interesting and simple. Let\u0026rsquo;s check how it can be done on Windows. For this, we will use a tool called Technitium MAC Address Changer.\nIt is a freeware utility to spoof the MAC address instantly.\nYou can download it in your windows machine from here: https://technitium.com/tmac/\nSteps\nIt is very simple to use, follow the steps given below,\nDownload and install Technitium Execute the file Go to the network connections tab in Technitium Select Wifi Select Random MAC Address option Click on Change Now. That\u0026rsquo;s it. It\u0026rsquo;s done.\nCheck\nSimply go to the Windows command line and run the command ipconfig /all.\nNotice the change in the MAC address.\nLater, you can go to Technitium and restore the original one again.\nPreventing MAC Spoofing #\rKnowing the skills is great but, it is also necessary to know how to prevent it. Let\u0026rsquo;s check that out.\nMAC spoofing can be a big problem on shared segment networks. However, the current generations of Ethernet switches are offering us a basis for defeating this kind of intrusion by offering us MAC locking.\nMAC Locking #\rIt is possible to lock a MAC address to a specific physical port on the switch.\nWhen MAC-locking locks a MAC/port combination, it prevents the MAC address from being used from any other port on the segment.\nThis combined with static ARP and MAC/IP filters could totally eradicate the spoofing possibilities on a shared-segment network.\nExpensive, managed switches allow port locking, but the disadvantage is the overhead cost.\nUsing ARP Tables #\rThe use of the (static) ARP table in combination with the routing table could prevent most of the shared-segment spoofing possibilities.\nMost operating systems by default do not check if a received IP datagram originated from a local MAC address matches the MAC addresses in the static ARP table, or if the external datagram matches the MAC address of one of the known network routers that have a valid route entry in the routing table.\nUnauthorized MAC addresses are therefore exposed, and the decision to take defensive action can then take place.\nReal Life Facts #\rMAC Address is not an attack that will give you access to systems, but it will play a very important role in network hacking. MAC Spoofing is one of the important steps in Wifi Hacking. Heard of something called MITM(Man-In-The-Middle) Attacks? MAC Spoofing plays a very important role there as well. You can change your MAC to the MAC of another system and pretend to be someone else. Thus you can sit in the middle of the network and intercept it. #BasicHacking #0xShakhawat\nwanna support my work! well just buy me a coffee\nFollow Shakhawat Hossain for more cybersecurity posts \u0026amp; subscribe my YouTube channel 0xShakhawat.\n","date":"3 February 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blogs/hack-the-mac/","section":"Blogs","summary":"","title":"Hack The MAC Address","type":"blogs"},{"content":"","date":"3 February 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/networking/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Networking","type":"categories"},{"content":"Hi, I\u0026rsquo;m Shakhawat Hossain.
